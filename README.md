# Action Framework

## Introduction
The Action Framework is a strategic methodology designed to optimize interaction with AI language models. It provides a structured approach to formulate prompts for better AI outputs. 

## Three-Step Iterative Process
The framework revolves around a three-step iterative process:
1. Goal specification - Clearly stating what you want the AI to generate.
2. Action set-up - Framing the AI's role and providing contextual instructions.
3. Evaluation & refinement - Evaluating the AIâ€™s output and iteratively refining the prompts to get the desired output.

## Benefits
- Improves effectiveness and accuracy of AI outputs
- Encourages iterative refinement, leading to better results over time
- Provides a systematic approach to prompt engineering

# Python Script for Interaction with AI
```python
def interact_with_ai(goal, action_setup, refinement_steps):
    output = None
    for i in range(refinement_steps):
        prompt = f"{action_setup}\n{goal}"
        output = AI.generate(prompt)  # hypothetical AI generate function
        if output is satisfactory:    # hypothetical evaluation condition
            break
        else:
            refine_prompt()  # hypothetical function to refine prompt based on feedback
    return output
